This exercise has some prepared code to get started faster. It resembles a blog. There’s authors (Nat and Sam) and some blog posts about trees and computers. At the moment there’s no relation between them. Let’s update the blog posts so that they link to the author.

In the basic lessons we’ve already learned that a link in IPLD is represented as an object with a slash as its own field:

```javascript
const link = {'/': 'a-base-encoded-cid'}
```

Modify the two existing blog posts and add a new field `author` that links to the author of the blog post. The post about trees was authored by Sam, Nat wrote the one about computers. Remember to use `tobBaseEncodedString()` to make the CIDs ready for the links.

Before modifying the code, please open the developer tools and submit the code. You’ll see the CIDs of the blog posts on the console. When you look at the console again after you’ve modified the code, you’ll see the CIDs being different.
