With every blog post linked together, we can return all of with only the CID of the last.

The `prev` fields contains a link to the previous blog post. You can use that CID and the `ipfs.dag.get()` API to get the previous blog.

Note: the `ipfs.dag.get()` API returns an object with a `value` attribute which is the node you want. Also, **links will be binary encoded**, so if you want them to be CID instances you'll need to use the `cid` module.

```javascript
let cid = new CID((await ipfs.dag.get(someCid)).value.linkName['/'])
```

This kind of traversal could be used to create an overview page that lists all blog posts.

Fill in the body of the `traversePosts()` function. It takes the CID object of the most recent blog post as input. Use that to get the object from IPFS and follow the `prev` links. The return value of the function should be an array with the CID objects of all nodes (including the input CID).
