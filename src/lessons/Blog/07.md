With every blog post linked together, we can return all of them but just knowing the CID of the first one. The `prev` fields contain a link to the previous blog post. You can use the CID of that link to `ipfs.dag.get()` the previous blog.

Such a traversal could be used to have an overview page that lists all blog posts.

Fill in the body of the `traversePosts()` function. It takes the CID object of the most recent blog post as input. Use that one to follow the `prev` links. The return value of the function should be an array with the CID objects of all nodes (including the input CID).
