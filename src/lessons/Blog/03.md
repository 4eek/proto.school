A single object can link to multiple other nodes. To illustrate this, we are creating new nodes which could be used for a tag cloud.

Links don’t necessarily need to be the value of a field (we call those “named links”). They could also be part of an array. This is perfect for our use case. Create a new node for the tags “outdoor” and “hobby”. The structure should look like this:

```javavscript
{
  tag: "name-of-the-tag",
  posts: [
    // links to the CIDs
  ]
}
```

Insert those objects into IPLD via `ipld.dag.put()` and return the two resulting CIDs as array.

Please note that arrays are order-dependent. This means that the order matters for the CID creation. An object with the same element within an array, but different order results in a different CID.
