You want to create an overview page that is listing your blog posts strictly chronological. You could do it the same way as with the tags. You would need to update that page (create a new node), every time you add a new blog post. That sounds like a lot of waste: creating new nodes with only a small thing changed. There’s a better way. Whenever you create a new blog post, you can link to the previous one directly.

You can use those links to create the overview page dynamically (which we’ll do in the next exercise).

We know the CID of a blog post as soon as it is stored in IPLD. Hence we can use that CID to link from newer blog posts to older ones. We introduce a new field named `prev` in our blog posts. This field links to the previous blog post.

Link the blog post in chronological order. The oldest one is the one about trees, then there’s the one about computers. The one about “dogs” is the newest one. Once you’ve updated them, return the CID of the blog post about “dogs”.
