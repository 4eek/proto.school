The previously created blog post about dogs is completely disconnected from the others. Now, update the nodes that represent the tag cloud.

First, you'll need to add the new blog post to the “hobby” tag.

There isn’t a node for the “funny” tag yet either, so create a new node with the same data as the other tag nodes and add a link to the blog post about dogs.

Return the CIDs of all three tag nodes.
