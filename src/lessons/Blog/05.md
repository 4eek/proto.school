The previously created blog post about dogs is completely disconnected from the others. Hence update the nodes that represent the tag cloud. You need to add the new blog post to the “hobby” tag.

There isn’t a node for the “funny” tag yet, hence create such a node with the same shape as the other tag nodes and add a link to the blog post about dogs.

Return the CIDs of all three tag nodes.
