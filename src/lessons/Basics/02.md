One important features of DAGs is the ability to link them together.

The way you express links in the `ipfs` dag store is with an object with a
single `'/'` attribute pointed at the `CID` of another node.

For example, if we wanted one node to have a link called "foo" pointed
to another CID it might look like:

```javascript
{
  foo: {'/': 'z43AaGEvwdfzjrCZ3Sq7DKxdDHrwoaPQDtqF4jfdkNEVTiqGVFW'}
}
```

In `js-ipfs` we tend to work with instances of `CID` from the `cids` module.
Links need to be expressed with a base encoded string, so to create the
structue above you might use:

```javascript
{
  foo: {'/': cid.toBaseEncodedString()}
}
```

For this test, create a link named `bar` that points to the node we
created in the first the lesson, `put` it into IPFS and return the new
cid.

For your convenience the code area is
pre-populated with the creation of the node we're linking to.
