The “hello world!” node with the link to an image could represent a biography. Let’s create new node representing a blog post that links to the biogrpahy.

If you want to use a CID within a link, you need to convert it to an encoded string. Use the `.toBaseEncodedString()` method of the CID object.

Create a new node which has the fields `contents` with some value and a field called `author` which links to the biography. Return the CID of the blog post.
