# Your first link

TODO vmx 2018-07-20: Add some image globally

IPLD supports multiple formats. We’ve already seend `CBOR` which is used to store JSON. Another one is `raw` where you can put any binary data you want. For this lesson we’ve already pre-populated IPFS with an image. It has the CID `TODO`.

One of the core features of IPLD is links. In JSON it is represented as `{"/": “some-cid-to-link-to"}`.

Add a new link into your “Hello world” JSON object. Put it under the field name `"pic"`. Insert the new object into IPFS and return its CID.
